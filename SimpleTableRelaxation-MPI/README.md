# CM30225 Parallel ComputingAssessed Coursework Assignment 2

## Specification

The objective of this assignment is to give you experience of using MPI on a distributed memory architecture; plus afeel for how parallel problems scale on such architectures.

The problem to solve is the same as Assignment 1. But, now, you will be using MPI on a distributed memoryarchitecture.

As before, run your code on varying sizes of arrays and varying numbers of cores, but in a distributed memoryconfiguration.

A complete solution consists of

* properly commented source code, together with any extra information you feel will help, such as describingyour approach to the parallelisation of your solution, how you thought about messaging overhead, and so on

* (excerpts from) the results of yourcorrectness testingof your code with a description of your testing process

* comments, graphs or any other relevant details of yourscalability investigation, with particular reference tospeedup and efficiency
